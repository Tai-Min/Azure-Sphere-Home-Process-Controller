# Azure Sphere Home Process Controller
My entry for [Home Is Where the Hack Is Challenge, with Avnet Azure Sphere](https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-94716?CMP=e-email-ADH-e14-Com-170420-Avnet-2391) (Grand Prize winner!)

Industrial like PID / Two state process controller with web based configuration, MQTT communication and Azure IoT Central integration.

This repository contains source code for both High level application and real time core of Azure Sphere board, source codes for Arduino expansion cards, electronic design files for KiCad, housing design files for Autodesk Inventor and STL files for 3d printing.
